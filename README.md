# SPOTPRO
This project is based on the original spot micro, which is known for its extreme stability, and wide range of tasks. It can perform duties from reconnaissance to weather reports, even military missions, and survey in places humans can't reach such as in a chemical disaster.The main aim, is 
1. To first make it controllable on laptop or mobile
2. To add AI into it, and make it perform long-range tasks all by itself, like, go to a particular area, and come back with artifacts, or even launch drones to make it reach the owner, with the artifacts.
   Hence, it is a very smart tool for use during disasters, and wars, or maybe archaelogical adventures.

### References/Bibliography
First of, instead of researching on this private project, I would like to request you to look into the resources I looked up into, 

1. https://sites.google.com/view/senior-tech-project/   (I chose these guys, mainly because they listed down all their steps, with perfect details)
2. https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/        (The official ones)
3. https://novaspotmicro.com/                           (They extended the original design, and added some rc features, and, umm-what not. They even added the holes for ports for robotic arms, I think)
4. https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32      (He editted the 3d models, to accomodate ESP32 DEVKITC)


But, if you are just like me, and do not trust the makes of the other users as well, you are more that free to follow this repository. I will try to privide each and every detail possible, while making this project.

### Step 1 - Electronics

First, The reason many people edited the original stl files, is because they wanted to use the best ttechnology available- First it was 
1. Arduino Mega, the original model
2. and then RPi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano
3. and then ESP32 series.
Second, I thought of using my favorite *ESP32 S3 DEVKITC N8R8 1 BOARD*, but, it only has basic capability, like face recognition, server creation, 802.11, and BLE.(But still, overwhelmingly strong than most esp32, and arduino board, no, all arduino boards).
Third, What I did, for the first steps, I will be using esp32, but, later, I will be using RPi 0/3/4/5 b+ for the AI and automated control part(much later on, patience) Why not Jetson Nano? Because I dont trust it. It would be the first time I will be using it. I will still be listing all the options in the below table. ALL THE CAPS-LOCKED ITEMS ARE OPTIONAL, AND NOT INCLUDED IN MY DESIGN.

The total size of the body turns out to be about 32cm(length) x 1ocm(width) x 7cm(height)
the total size of each fully straight leg turns out to be about 5cm(length) x 3cm(width) x 30cm(height)
Total robot size, when robot is at ease, in their original positions: 22cm(height) x 30cm(length) x 22cm(width)
Approximately, it will take 7-9 days to print all items, assuming all are left 24/7 no, 24/9. It consumes 300metres of 1.75mm filament, approx
1 whole spool of prusament 1kg pla will be used, and prolly 1.25...
